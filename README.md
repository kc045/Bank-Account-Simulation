 <h1>Bank Account Simulation</h1>
 
 <br>This Java program simulates a simple Bank Account Management System using object-oriented programming. 

 <h3>PIN Verification </h3>
 - The user is first prompted to enter a PIN (3032).

- Only if the entered PIN matches, the user is allowed to access the account menu.

 <h3>Main Menu Options </h3>
 
 The menu provides the following choices:

Check Balance – Displays the current account balance.

Withdraw Money – Allows the user to withdraw money if sufficient balance exists.

Deposit Money – Lets the user deposit money into the account.

Exit – Terminates the session.

- Uses Scanner for user input.

- Implements method calls for each operation: checkBalance(), withdrawMoney(), depositMoney().

- Uses looping via recursive menu() calls to return to the main menu after each operation.

- Ensures input validation like checking sufficient balance before withdrawal.
